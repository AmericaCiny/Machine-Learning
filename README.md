# Project 1
Create linear regression to predict Estimated Shares Outstanding, Explain how multicollinearity can affect the interpretation of a linear regression model's coefficients, Create a histogram of the p-values to detect the skeweness, BH procedure to control the FDR with a q of 0.1, apply the BH procedure at different q values to test the Sensitivity.

# Project 2
Data Exploration and Visualization, Develop a logistic regression model to predict whether tumour is malignant or benign, Model Evaluation using appropriate metrics, Testing Interactions Between Features, create full model and reduced model and compare their performances.

# Project 3
Develop a Linear regression model to predict price of house in Melbourne, Model Evaluation, Set up a Lasso regression model with specified parameters and fit it to the training data, Estimate AIC, AICc, BIC, as well as 5-fold CV for both models using only the training data. Estimate the models true OOS performance by computing their deviance on the test data.
